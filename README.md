# PHP-Console
A simple console for PHP 
I created this page to make it more elegant and stylish when running some simple PHP code. It's used by me and my lap colleges as a PHP console.
You can check how it works simply by adding your PHP code in the specified area inside the page and seeing the results in the console.
